# Forest-fire-data-analysis-by-Ranom-forest-regression
Fire in the forest can occur naturally or by humans. Naturally, fire takes place due to extreme drought, hot weather, lightning or combustion of dry leaves and scobs. Human activities like throwing cigarettes, especially in forest areas or using borne fire also lead to fires.So, fires which take place due to humans, are identified earlier than naturally occurring fires. There are various factors involved when a region catches fire. The hot and dry weather works as catalysts for fire. Since when there is fire in any region then the temperature of the region will become high due to fire. So increase in temperature is one of the factors which can help in fire detection events.
We will also calculate the accuracy, recall, and precision of these ML Algorithms.
